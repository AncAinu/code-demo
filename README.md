# Code Demo

## Architecture

### Dependencies

The project use cocoapods as a dependency manager, for the purpose of this project, because it is the most used.

#### Alamofire

Most used swift network layer. It seems rather too much boilerplate to rewrite the network layer entirely especially for a small project.

## Source control

The project use Git, with a git-flow method. Although, git-flow isn't very useful in a single man project, having at least the branches master / develop separated is of good practice.
