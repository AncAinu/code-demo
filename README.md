# Code Demo

## Technical choices

### Interface builder

The project won't use interface builder, that's a subject for debate, albeit the personal preference, it is rather easier to show skills through code which will appear on git than in IB.

## Architecture

### Dependencies

The project use cocoapods as a dependency manager, for the purpose of this project, because it is the most used.

#### Alamofire

Most used swift network layer. It seems rather too much boilerplate to rewrite the network layer entirely especially for a small project.

#### SnapKit

SnapKit is an Auto Layout DSL that facilitate and shorten the use of AutoLayout programmatically.

## Source control

The project use Git, with a git-flow method. Although, git-flow isn't very useful in a single man project, having at least the branches master / develop separated is of good practice.
