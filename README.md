# Code Demo

## Architecture

### Dependencies

The project use cocoapods as a dependency manager, for the purpose of this project, because it is the most used.

#### Alamofire

Most used swift network layer. It seems rather too much boilerplate to rewrite the network layer entirely especially for a small project.
